                    Sofia's Alley has been serving up the finest Italian cuisine since 1952. The name "Sofia's Alley" pays homage to
                    the owner Sofia's original street side restaraunt she operated in Italy. "Sophia Sophia, when are you opening your door?
                    I want a me a linguini alla luigi polenta mario", a common statement Sophia would hear. Her food goes down in local legends for its quality, elegence
                    and enchanting flavour. However, food was not the only reason the people of Italy loved Sofia's Alley. It was its sense of
                    family and community. You see, when Sofia was a child she lost both of her parents to a fire. Ever since then she has been
                    longing for that feeling of warmth and companionship. "Sophia's Alley" is more than just a restaraunt to her, it is a family, one 
                    that she has nurtured and opened up to the world so that everyone may feel the warmth that she has longed for her entire life.

                    welcome in Sophia's Alley :3
